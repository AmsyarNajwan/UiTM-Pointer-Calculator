This code builds a simple CGPA calculator for UiTM students. The page uses Tailwind CSS for layout and a small JavaScript function to process your inputs.

The tool helps you calculate your GPA based on your subject grades and credit hours. You enter your subject name, credit unit, and grade. The script uses UiTM grade points to compute your result.

Key points

• You enter six subjects.
• You type each credit unit and grade.
• The script checks your grade.
• The script multiplies your grade point with your credit unit.
• The script totals all grade points and credit units.
• You see your final GPA in two decimal places.
• You see an error message if you type an invalid grade.

Why it helps you

• You save time.
• You avoid manual mistakes.
• You see fast results.
• You get clear feedback if your grade input is wrong.

Example

• Grade A with 3 credits gives you 12 points.
• Grade B with 3 credits gives you 9 points.
• Total points 21 with total credits 6 gives you a GPA of 3.50.

You get a clean layout, a simple form, and clear output. You only need to enter your data and press Calculate GPA.
